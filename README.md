In this project, I aimed to uncover insights about the marketplace for books. I conducted data cleaning and exploration of a dataset called Book Sales and Ratings on Kaggle. A few areas that I focused on include a comparison of publishers, top authors by publisher revenue, and book genres. This analysis, while paired with additional datasets from marketing or SEO, can better illustrate the user journey of customers, the efficacy of marketing and promotions, and the distinctions between digital and brick-and-mortar retail.
