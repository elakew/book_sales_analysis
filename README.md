In this project, I aimed to uncover insights about the marketplace for books. I conducted data cleaning and exploration of a dataset called Book Sales and Ratings on Kaggle. A few areas that I focused on include a comparison of publishers, top authors by publisher revenue, and book genres. This analysis, when paired with additional data sources from marketing or operations, can better illustrate the user journey of customers, the efficacy of marketing and promotions, and the distinctions between digital and brick-and-mortar retail. I plan to explore some of this areas in future projects.
