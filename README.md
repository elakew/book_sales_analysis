In this project, I aimed to uncover insights about the marketplace for books, particularly with a focus on publisher revenue. I conducted data cleaning and exploration in SQLite and Python of a Kaggle dataset called Book Sales and Ratings. I explored a few areas such as top publishing years for books sold, genres, and revenue percentage of gross sales. This analysis, when paired with additional data sources from marketing or operations, can be leveraged to better understand the user journey of customers, the efficacy of marketing intiiatives and promotions, and the distinctions between digital and brick-and-mortar retail. I plan to explore some of this areas in future projects.
